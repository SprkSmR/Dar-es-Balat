`malloc()` is a function in the C programming language used for dynamic memory allocation. It stands for "memory allocation." It is part of the standard C library (`stdlib.h`). 

When you need to allocate memory dynamically (i.e., at runtime), you use `malloc()`. This allows you to allocate memory based on the size you need, and the memory remains allocated until you explicitly deallocate it using the `free()` function.

Here's the basic syntax of `malloc()`:

```c
void* malloc(size_t size);
```

It takes one argument, `size`, which specifies the number of bytes to allocate. It returns a pointer to the allocated memory if successful, or `NULL` if it fails to allocate memory.

For example, to allocate memory for an array of 10 integers:

```c
int *array = (int*)malloc(10 * sizeof(int));
if (array == NULL) {
    // Memory allocation failed
    // Handle the error
} else {
    // Memory allocation successful
    // Use the allocated memory
    // Don't forget to free the memory when done: free(array);
}
```

It's important to note a couple of things:

1. You need to explicitly cast the return value of `malloc()` to the appropriate pointer type (`int*`, `char*`, etc.) in C. However, this isn't necessary in C++.
2. Always check if the return value of `malloc()` is `NULL` to ensure that the memory allocation was successful. If `malloc()` fails to allocate memory, it returns `NULL`.

Here's a simple example of how you would use `malloc()` to allocate memory for a dynamic array of integers:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main() {
    int n;
    printf("Enter the number of integers: ");
    scanf("%d", &n);

    // Allocate memory for n integers
    int *array = (int*)malloc(n * sizeof(int));
    if (array == NULL) {
        printf("Memory allocation failed\n");
        return 1; // Exiting with an error code
    }

    // Input elements of the array
    printf("Enter %d integers:\n", n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        scanf("%d", &array[i]);
    }

    // Print the elements of the array
    printf("You entered:");
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        printf(" %d", array[i]);
    }
    printf("\n");

    // Free the allocated memory
    free(array);

    return 0; // Exiting successfully
}
```

Remember that after you allocate memory using `malloc()`, you need to free it using the `free()` function to avoid memory leaks.
