`fgetc()` is a function in the C standard library (defined in `<stdio.h>`) used to read a single character from a file. It reads the next character from the specified file stream and advances the file position indicator to the next character.

Here's the syntax of `fgetc()`:

```c
int fgetc(FILE *stream);
```

It takes one argument, `stream`, which is a pointer to a `FILE` object representing the file to read from. It returns the character read as an `unsigned char` converted to an `int` or `EOF` (End-of-File) to indicate failure or end of file.

Here's a simple example of how to use `fgetc()` to read characters from a file:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    FILE *file;
    char filename[] = "example.txt";
    int ch;

    // Open the file in read mode
    file = fopen(filename, "r");
    if (file == NULL) {
        perror("Error opening file");
        return 1;
    }

    // Read characters from the file until EOF is reached
    while ((ch = fgetc(file)) != EOF) {
        putchar(ch); // Print the character to the standard output
    }

    // Close the file
    fclose(file);

    return 0;
}
```

In this example:

- We open a file named "example.txt" in read mode (`"r"`).
- We check if the file was opened successfully.
- We read characters from the file using `fgetc()` in a loop until `EOF` is returned, indicating the end of the file.
- Inside the loop, we print each character to the standard output using `putchar()`.
- Finally, we close the file using `fclose()`.

It's important to handle errors appropriately when using `fgetc()`, especially when dealing with file operations. Also, remember to close the file when you're done reading from it to release system resources.
